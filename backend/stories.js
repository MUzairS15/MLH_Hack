Local legend says she’s the ghost of a young woman from a well-to-do family who became pregnant out of wedlock.  To cover up the scandal her family sent her to a convent to have the child intending the baby to then be put up for adoption after she gave birth to it.  But after she gave birth to the child the young mother became very attached to it.  When she saw her father coming to the convent to collect her she panicked and fled.  Eventually she reached West Hill where she tragically decided to jump off it's cliff edge with her baby rather than be parted from it.  The young lady died but the baby actually survived the fall.
